        <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
            <div class="input-section" style="text-align: justify;">
Typing in <strong>'lambda'</strong> on any input field will automatically replace it with <strong>'λ'</strong>.
            </div>   
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <div class="input-section" style="text-align: justify;">
The syntax in the code is very sensitive. Global definitions are always automatically applied, but if you want to
write your own application from scratch inside the expression input field, you'll need to explicitly define the function
being applied. <br><br>

- typing in an expression such as <strong>'add 1 2'</strong> will automatically convert it to <strong>'(λm.λn.λf.λx.((m f) ((n f) x))) 1 2'</strong>.<br><br>
- however, the interpreter will not see any application if you type in <strong>'λm.λn.λf.λx.((m f) ((n f) x)) 1 2'</strong>, meaning it will be ignored.<br><br>

So, remember, <strong>always</strong> wrap your explicit definitions around parentheses if you want to avoid issues!
            </div>   
        <h3>Beware the "Y"!</h3>
        <div class="input-section" style="text-align: justify;">
Looking at the pure untyped lambda calculus paradigm, you might ask how does one get around <strong>loops</strong>? We naturally think first in terms of either self-referential
functions or for/while-loops (recursive vs iterative approaches), however, in pure untyped lambda calculus we support neither self-referencing, nor is there any native support for
iterations (goto functions). Instead, we have to get creative.<br>
We use a trick called a <strong>fixed-point combinator</strong>. This is how we define The <strong>Y fixed-point combinator</strong>: <strong>Y = λf.(λx.(f (x x))) (λx.(f (x x)))</strong><br>
The combinator works by passing a function as its own argument, which creates a cycle that simulates recursion. Our interpreter natively stores a Y combinator in its global definitions that
can be called at any point in the code, featuring as well an implementation of Y for a factorial function.<br>
But, be very mindful when using this function. It is very dangerous, and can very easily lead to infinite recursion! Whenever you must use the Y combinator, make sure to add a reachable base case.
