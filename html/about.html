                    <strong>Alonzo Church</strong> was an American mathematician best known as being the founder of <strong>lambda calculus</strong>, originally a theory of computability based around untyped functions.
                    Around the middle of spring of 1936, Church published a paper named “An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory,” in the American Journal of Mathematics. Followed by Alan Turing's paper published later that year, “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” reaching the same conclusions as Church.
                    Essentially, after developing lambda calculus, Alonzo Church began studying the limits of computability in parallel with Alan Turing, who had recently invented the Turing machine. Church and Turing aimed to find out what <strong>could</strong> and what <strong>could not</strong> be computed. They discovered that the <strong>decision problem</strong> was ultimately uncomputable.
                    Because both papers were developed in parallel, we call this thesis the <strong>Church-Turing thesis</strong>.<br>
                    This interpreter is therefore called the <strong>Church Interpreter</strong> in tribute to Alonzo Church's fundamental contributions to the field of Computer Science.

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <div class="input-section" style="text-align: justify;">
                In this site, I feature a <strong>JavaScript</strong>-written interpreter for pure untyped <strong>lambda calculus</strong>, supporting <strong>currying</strong> implementation, in applicative order. (*)(**) It leverages trees in order to create expressions. For instance, the expression <strong>`λx.(x (λy.y))`</strong> can be represented in the following tree, where `@` is an application:
                <div class="final" style="text-align: left; justify-content: center; justify-items: center; align-items: center; align-content: center;">
                    λx.       <- defines a bound           
                     |                                         
                     @        <- applies terms          
                    / \                                 
                   x   λy.    <- bound terms                     
                        |                               
                        @                               
                        y                               
                </div>
                In lambda calculus, everything is a <strong>function</strong>. There are no primitive data types like integers or booleans; instead, these are encoded using functions. This function-only model allows lambda calculus to simulate computation and express logic with minimal syntax. It is famous for being the simplest, most minimalistic approach to programming languages.

                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: justify; ">(*) By this, I mean the code simulates an untyped lambda calculus environment. </p>
                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: justify; ">(**) When I say this code supports 'currying', I mean that in this interpreter, declarations such as λabc.x are not shorthand for λa.λb.λc.x; rather, abc is treated as a single variable name. To represent a function that takes multiple arguments, you must write separate lambdas for each argument, such as λa.λb.λc.x, which corresponds to a curried function taking three arguments.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Background</h3>
                I began working on this project during the second half of <strong>2024</strong> with the help of my logic programming professor, <strong>Frank de Alcantara</strong>. The concepts appeared so difficult and abstract to me at first that I found the only way to properly understand them was by implementing them in a programming language I was already familiar with. Thus, I originally began working on a Pythonic interpreter that leveraged the use of function wrappers and decorators to achieve a native Python implementation of pure untyped lambda calculus.
                <br>
                When I first showed the Python interpreter to my professor, he immediately challenged me to build a <strong>website</strong>. (*) At first, I attempted to convert all functions and classes directly; but I gradually found out that, for the implementation he requested, it would be too great an undertaking for something that would barely fit his specifications. Instead, I rewrote the entire structure and planning of my code, instead focusing on syntax and grammar parsing directly on strings, though much of the object-oriented approach carried over to this project.

                <p style="font-size: small; text-align: left; ">(*) It was, in fact, just a suggestion, but I took it quite seriously when he said it was maybe too difficult with the time I had on my hands. </p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The code</h3>
                All that being said, the code itself works rather intuitively using an <strong>object-oriented</strong> approach. I first sketched my program idea like this:
                <br>
                There are four main classes: a `Parser` class, an `Expression` class, an `Application` class, and a `Variable` class. <br>
                1. <strong>Expressions</strong> are tokenized and parsed into lambda terms.<br>
                2. The interpreter applies function applications and performs <strong>substitutions</strong>, replacing variables with arguments.<br>
                3. The interpreter uses <strong>beta reduction</strong> (applying functions to arguments) and <strong>alpha conversion</strong> (renaming variables) to simplify expressions.<br>
                4. Finally, the evaluation.<br>
